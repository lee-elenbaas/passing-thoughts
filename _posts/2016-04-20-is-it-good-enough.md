# Is it good enough? 

That question keeps nagging me when I want to decide whether to publish the post on not. 

On the original passing-thoughts website I had sections.

* seeds - section for raw ideas, single lines and other stuff that was definitely not worth publishing, but perhaps with work might be something more in the future. This was visible only to me. 

* passing-thoughts - section for more structured items. Things that I already wanted some outside feedback on them. But only from the small and close to me group that was allowed to view it. 

* formed-thoughts - sections open to the public where things I felt were mature enough went up for display. 

Now with this new form, I am lacking this second section. I might add it in the future. 

For now, I decided to bring even that second category to the public eye. Perhaps someone will like it. 
I just hope the quality price will not be too high.
