fist time I got a glimpse of what others visiting the site actually see.

And I have a lot of work in how it is organized and visualized.

For starters - apparently not everyone understand where a post ends and a new one begins - this is especially true for posts that are long and contain multiple headers.

Secondly my division to categories is far from being visible to the visitor - something I already started to work on.

But the bottom line is that I think I will need help with the visual design and artwork in order to make it better.
