This will probably be a series of posts, since it will be an ongoing project.

## History

So lets start with the history:
- We had a few home computers that needed to share files between them. I considered NAS as an option, but dismissed it at the time for budget and headache reasons. Instead I used an old laptop as home entertainment center.
- That HP laptop lasted until its display dies, then we moved to a WD PowerBook 1T
- When that PowerBook died, we already got accustomed to have easy to access network storage, so we upgraded to WD MyCloud 2T.
- That MyCloud died last week. After it had managed to also get us used to mobile backup.
- So now i am looking for a new replacement.

## Requirments

This time I want to make a more informed decision. So I decided to start by looking at what it is I really want.
