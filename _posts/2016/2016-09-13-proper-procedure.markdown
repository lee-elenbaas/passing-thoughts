There is a certain order things has to be done.

Not due to real constraints, but due to legal thinking.

You have an agreement. Agreement naturally means both sides have to do something for the other side.

And when the other side does not uphold his end of the bargain you basically have several options:
- Blow the whole agreement
- Ignore it and stay quite
- Do it yourself and demand compensation

The last option is the trickiest one, it is based on three steps.
- The first step, do it yourself, is easy, just do it.
- The second step, getting the compensation is usually easy as well, you can always do less from your side
  of the agreement.
- The last part is the hard part, making the other side to accept the compensation.

If the other side does not accept the compensation it can lead to him starting the cycle again, but from the other side, leading to a blow up. It can lead to legal arguments.
