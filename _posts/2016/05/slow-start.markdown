Today was the second day i was informed that my performance was not up to the expected level.

I can't say i am happy about it.

This job is hard to swallow.

It brings me back to my high-school days of long stretches of code with no interruptions.
Yet i am expected to know what i am doing instantly. Or at least that is the feeling i am getting.

The commute time that is net 5 hours a day, but in really takes more, also takes its toll. Both in time spent at work, and with time at home.

When i look back at my time in other work places. I always had the problem of slow starting. I remember my former boss reprimanding me about it in my trial time at my last work. Eventually i grow to be a prominent member of the team under him.
I can hope the same will happen here, if I'll survive the coming weeks.
