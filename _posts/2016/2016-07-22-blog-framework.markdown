As part of playing around with the blog, i decided to make it slightly easier to use.

## SparkleShare

I have configured my SparkleShare to make it easier to edit pots, by allowing it to handle the sync into GitHub.

Oddly enough the windows version of SparkleShare 1.4 does not support sync with a github repository.
Instead I used version 1.6 for linux so this did not slow me down much.

## Disqus

I have also added Disqus to the post pages
