You approach me with passion in your eyes

sneak around me,

hunting me, hounting me,

slowly getting closer

not touching

i can feel your breath, smell you

but can't reach

my skin tingles when you almost touch it

the hair on my hands and legs stand to attention when you fly your hand next to it

electricity

torture that continue forever
