# New job

Started a new job yesterday. I am back in the position of learning from scratch. 

This new company has a strong emphasis on the organizational culture: 

* How to write the code
* How to get a task
* How to work on it
* How to report it
* How to email
* How to communicate

And more... 

I can tell from the tools and the code base that the company has roots deep into the C/C++ Eco system, despite the work itself being in JavaScript. This means different tools and mindset then in most other JavaScript places I encountered. 

Something I'll have to get used too. 

# Commute time

But the mind boggling thing to me is the commute time. 

2.5 hours for each direction. 5 hours a day. Half a day goes for every workday. 

Yes I know it before I took the job, but knowing is not the same as feeling. 
Yesterday was the first day in a long while where I haven't seen any of my kids awake at all. I left before they woke up, and came back after they already fall asleep. 
Why this morning I left only after I saw them leaving for their day. 

## Transportation 

I rolled out a car since for it will be Russian Roulette with almost fully loaded gun. 

I know I will fall asleep on the wheel. The only questions are when it will happen, and how badly I'll be hurt. 

This leaves public transportation, that is less then friendly. 

## Current rout

* Home to bus station - same as with my previous work, mostly by car when my wife drop off the kids. 

* Bus to the train station - same as with the previous work. Sadly the bus usually arrive just as the train leaves so I have to wait for the next one. 

* Train to a more central station,where I'll wait for the train that will get me to work 

* Train to train station closest to work

* bus or shuttle to work

And the ride home is the same in reverse. 

# Mitigations

There are mitigating factors. 

I can start the work on the train. Most days there is enough space to work. I have the laptop with everything I need on it. I just need to organize it, something I plan to do this week. 

This should give about 90 min of offline work in each direction. 

I just realized I forgot to measure the times for each segment. I'll do it in the next few days and report it. 

I am rewriting this post, more annoyed then I was when I first wrote it, since I lost it over network issue along the way.
