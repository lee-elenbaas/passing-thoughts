# New job

Started a new job yesterday. I am back in the position of learning from scratch. 

This new company has a strong emphasis on the organizational culture: How to write the code; how to get a task; how to work on it; how to report it; how to email; how to communicate... 

I can tell from the tools and the code base that the company has roots deep into the C/C++ Eco system, despite the work itself being in JavaScript. This means different tools and mindset then in most other JavaScript places I encountered. 

Something I'll have to get used too. 

# Commute time

But the mind boggling thing to me is the commute time. 

2.5 hours for each direction. 5 hours a day. Half a day goes for every workday. 

Yes I know it before I took the job, but knowing is not the same as feeling. 
Yesterday was the first day in a long while where I haven't seen any of my kids awake at all. I left before they woke up, and came back after they already fall asleep. 
Why this morning I left only after I saw them leaving for their day. 

## Transportation 

I rolled out a car since for it will be Russian Roulette with almost fully loaded gun. 

I know I will fall asleep on the wheel. The only questions are when it will happen, and how badly I'll be hurt. 

This leaves public transportation, that is less then friendly. 

## Current rout

* Home to bus station - same as with my previous work, mostly by car when my wife drop off the kids. 

* Bus to the train station - same as with the previous work. Sadly the bus usually arrive just as the train leaves so I have to wait for the next one. 

* 

I am rewriting this post, more annoyed then I was when I first wrote it, since I lost it over network issue along the way.
