Small fire burning below the pot

Hot steam paints visions of a better life

A dash of work, a drop of studies

And a whole lot of responsibilities that add body to the
mix

<br>

Pour it when it boiled into small cups, and drink in small
sips

Taste the bitterness of the pain

The sweetness of joy

The hope, the loss, the life

<br>

Savor the aroma,

Inhale deeply

And then share it with those you love

Make it the greatest tea time for your soul
