Aim the camera in your head

click, and the moment is frozen in your memory

take out the tools

chisels, hammers and pokes

shape this image into words

work fast before it melts

not that it will ever go away

but hurry before it became something new.

<br>

When the work is done

Don't ever look back

The frozen fragment that was left from the moment

Never feels the same any more

Just take your distance

And read it a while later

As a new experience.
