Passing thoughts was originally hosted at zipnav.Free.Fr (long time dead) and served me as a communication platform with the world. 

Writing was alway easier for me than talking, at least on some topics. I remember a friend that saw I was not able to talk, who took me to a keyboard and we chatted over a text document about my pain.
