It took 8 months my Hola adventure.

It started with me not finding myself coding enough on Gigya, so I ended up participating in [Hola coding contest](http://hola.org/challenges) just for coding a bit more.

I did not do a good job at that contest, [my submission](https://bitbucket.org/lee_elenbaas/hola-2015-challenge-mail-filter) didn't pass the correctness test.
But apparently it was good enough to cought attention, so I got a job interview without looking for.

Meanwhile at Gigya question marks have been forming whether I should stay there, so I went to the interview.
And eventually took the offer.
