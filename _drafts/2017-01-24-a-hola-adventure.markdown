It took 8 months my Hola adventure.

It started with me not finding myself coding enough on Gigya, so I ended up participating in [Hola coding contest](http://hola.org/challenges) just for coding a bit more.

I did not do a good job at that contest, [my submission](https://bitbucket.org/lee_elenbaas/hola-2015-challenge-mail-filter) didn't pass the correctness test.
But apparently it was good enough to cought attention, so I got a job interview without looking for.

Meanwhile at Gigya question marks have been forming whether I should stay there, so I went to the interview.
And eventually took the offer.

According to the [Hola DNA](http://hola.org/dna) the first few weeks are a test, and they felt like one too.
Socially it felt even worse for me. The feeling was that people are afraid to say good morning to you, since you will be gone the next day.

The next few months were lonely programming, my assigned mentor was mostly out of the country, and the communication with him was purely a few product related questions, and some code issues.

There were positive aspects for working at Hola. The task was interesting, I enjoyed the fact that i was working on an open source project. The perks were fun. I think Hola is doing a good thing in how they treat the product, and in how they treat the code. I have disagreements with some of the choices Hola made in terms of technology, and conventions, but those are always compromises, and the compromises Hola did, are sensible.

This got me to a period of background interviews in other places, while maintaining the work at Hola. Some of those interviews went well, but when I looked back at the company and what was being offered. I kept on choosing to stay at Hola.

Then the winds of change started to flow, Hola pushed more resources, more manpower into the project I was in. And it started to feel like a team is being formed. This lasted about a month, and then it felt like it is being dwindled again.

The last blow was a reorganization that got me out of Hola, in fact this solved the conflict for me of whether to continue or not with Hola, they decided for me.
