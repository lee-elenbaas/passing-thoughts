With the introduction of a new train station, the ride now take a slightly less time (not significantly) and is less complicated.

My day today route today is like this:

- Home to bus station by car, my wife drops me off when she drops the kids
- Bus to the train station, if not properly times, the wait here can be up to 30min
- Train to Tel Aviv
- Switching trains in Tel Aviv, usually waiting more then 30min
- Train to Netanya
- Walk to the office, there is also a bus that is aligned the trian times, using it takes the same time, but will be good for bad weather.

And the ride back:
- Walk to the train station
- Train to Tel Aviv
- Switching trains at Tel Aviv, usually the wait is about 20min
- Train to the airport
- Bus from the airport to Shoham
- Walk from the bus stop Home

It takes a lot of my day to day time.

And it gives me a lot of free time, time to read, to write, to think.
Time that when i look back - was needed but I never know how to take it for myself.
Time i am not sure i want to give away again, despite it taking time from the family and from work.

I need to find a better balance
