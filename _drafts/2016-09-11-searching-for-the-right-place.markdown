I am still on a search for the right place for me.

The previous place was not good enough:
- I was not linked enough with the product
- I was feeling that I was being pushed aside
- There where too many changes that I did not liked

The new place is problematic:
- No real personal connection
- Long commute
- Loneliness in the work

The places I have seen are far from perfect:
- Product I dislike
- Work ethics I disagree with

So basically I am in an ongoing search for that "perfect" place.

I know there is no such thing as perfect, but right now, it feels better to keep
on looking then just stay motionless.
