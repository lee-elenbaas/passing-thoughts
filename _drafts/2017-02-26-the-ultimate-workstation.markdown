after an eternity of negativity towards the golden cage that apple provide its customers, i have became one such captive.

a new work forced (encouraged might be a better word) me to try a mac as my own station.

I have used mac before, but it was never the main station, only a necessity for certain specific tasks.

But now when it became my main station, the advantages are obvious to me.

The first and most important, things work. I have heard it before, and i always managed to get all i wanted to work on windows or linux, but on mac i don't need to make it happen, it just works. I am sure i will run into all sort of limitations in the future, but so far, nothing.

The second most important is parallels. It makes my one mac machine have windows and linux apps run smoothly in my mac desktop, sharing the same clipboard, trackpad keyboard and disk. I just have it all at the same time. The potential was there with VM technology on other systems, but again, here that potential was manifested.

osx with the freebsd core gives me the power to tweak with the insides if i must, so far didn't felt the need for it.

all in all, after a very short period, it looks like the ultimate workstation for me.
