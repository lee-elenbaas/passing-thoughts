The hardware i was waiting for has arrived last week.

A battered old computer that was not top of the line when I purchaced it 6 years ago.

A basic desktop tower, with basic spin disk, and 2GB ram.

The next step is to decide what OS is going to run it.

The obvious option is Free NAS, and i will probably test it to be sure. But its requirments are a little over the top for this computer, so it might be better to use something thinner.

I will not use this computer for all the NAS functionality i can dream on - the first step is to make it network storage for the download files. And to make the files already downloaded avaliable again in my network.
